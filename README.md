# RESPlite
A lite python code to fit RESP charges from Gaussian output. A harmonic restraint is used. The restraint strength and restraint center are tunnable. The user can also restrict lists of atoms to have identical charges.
---------------------------------------------
Input:
* ESP_grid.txt should contain the grid positions.
* ESP.txt should contain the electrostatic potential on each grid position.

Output:
* ESP partial charges
* RESP partial charges

See example for more detail.
